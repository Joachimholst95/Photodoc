# Photodoc

Photodoc is a small android application to edit pictures that you have stored on ur device or right after shooting a photo.
The project was created during my 2nd semester during my Mobile Computing studies.
There were two other collaborators whose names i will keep secluded. I was working mainly on the concept, the design and a few smaller features of the Application.
Photodoc was initially created for 3.1.3 and not changed since creation. On my Oreo 8.0.0 itÂ´s running good.
